## Backend

Here is the back-end part of our project: [https://github.com/ita-social-projects/OoS-Backend](https://github.com/ita-social-projects/OoS-Backend).

`develop` branch of the front-end corresponds to `develop` branch on the back-end. The same thing with `main` branches.

## Installation

### Required to install
* [Node.js 16/18](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* [Yarn Package Manager 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)
* [Angular CLI 16](https://angular.io/cli)

### Clone

Clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/ita-social-projects/OoS-Frontend`

---

## Usage

### Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `yarn e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
